# Perceptron Application Calculating the AND Logic
In this specific application, the Perceptron is being used to calculate the output of an AND gate. An AND gate is a logical gate that takes two inputs (either -1 or 1) and produces an output of 1 only if both inputs are 1. Otherwise, the output is -1.

Once the Perceptron is trained, it can be used to predict the output of an AND gate for any set of inputs. For example, if the inputs are (1, -1), the Perceptron should output -1. If the inputs are (1, 1), the Perceptron should output 1.

Overall, the Perceptron is a simple but powerful neural network that can be used for a variety of classification tasks. In this specific application, it demonstrates the ability to accurately model the behavior of an AND gate.
